pbbuttonsd (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to mistakes and some confusion the location
    of the pbbuttonsd configuration file changed
    several times. Upstream locates it at
    /etc/pbbuttonsd.conf for some releases now, but
    in the Debian package it was placed at
    /etc/pbbuttons/pbbuttonsd.conf. I have reverted
    this to use the upstream default again.
  
    The package will try to clean up old copies if
    they seem unchanged from the shipped version. If
    you have still a file /etc/pbbuttons/pbbuttonsd.conf
    after installation, the package wasn't sure what to
    do and left the decision up to you.
    Sorry for any trouble and/or confusion this caused.
  
    The directory /etc/pbbuttons isn't used anymore in
    the current packages and can be safely removed if
    still existant (after you have checked its contents,
    of course).
