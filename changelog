pbbuttonsd (0.7.9-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove i386 packages again. As the underlying hardware
    is so completly different it actually makes no sense
    right now to have the package there. Use software like
    mbpeventd instead. Urgency high to indicate that this
    is a change that would be good to have in etch.
    Also closes: #377708
